POSIX-compliant filesystems are the standard, other (including pseudo) filesystems attempt to expose a user-interface similar to those in POSIX-compliant filesystem.  Unfortunately this means there are sometimes leaky, incompatible, and even dangerous abstractions may be present.

Unix filesystems are byte-oriented.  They have no notion of encodings, and thus cannot be case-insensitive.  They do not normalize path names or data in any way.  The lack of conversion and normalization makes path lookup operations fast.

In a path name, only the \0" byte is disallowed.  The "/" byte is used to delimit directories so it may not exist in a path component itself.  Otherwise, path names may contain any other byte value (even gibberish).

Regular files will store any binary data stream without altering it in the kernel.  Filesystem operations have no notion of "lines" and won't convert CRLF line endings to LF or vice-versa.


There are many filesystem operations defined to be atomic in POSIX.  These atomic filesystem operations are ideal for helping multiple processes interact with each other safely.  Unfortunately, they also make POSIX-compliance difficult for implementations of network/distributed filesystems.

We will cover atomic operations in detail as we progress, including caveats for working with non-POSIX filesystems.
