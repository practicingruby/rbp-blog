=title USP: Regular files and metadata
=timestamp Sep 20, 2011 at 4:13 AM
=description This article presents the various types of meta data of a file which can be obtained from the kernel.  We also learn how to access this information from Ruby.
=entry

Regular files on a persistent filesystem are pointers / links to internal metadata known as inodes.  The implementation details of inodes vary between various filesystems and is usually not the concern of user space.  User space developers should only need to know a few common traits about inodes

h3. device number (File::Stat#dev)

The device number is a unique integer identifier for the device an inode belongs to.  Each file system partition is considered its own "device", so a device number does not necessarily correspond to a physical device (e.g. hard disk drive)

This device number is unique within a running Unix system, no two "devices" may have the same device number at the same point in time.

h3. inode number (File::Stat#ino)

The inode number is unique integer identifier for an inode within a particular device.  Like PIDs, FDs, and device numbers, they are opaque pointers to complex objects in kernel space.

The combination of device and inode number is required to uniquely identify any inode (and thus file) in the system.

h3. File Names

In many cases, there is a 1:1 relationship between file names and inodes.  That is, each file name points to its own inode, much like how one variable points to one Ruby object:

p(.       ".bashrc" -> inode_number=123, device_number=456

It is important to know the file name -> inode relationship is one way.  Inodes do not know which file name(s) it has pointing to it.  Similarly, Ruby objects do not know which variable name(s) are assigned to it.

When working with File objects, one should know the File#path method return value in Ruby is determined in user space when File.open is called, _not_ when File#path is called:

<pre name="code" class="ruby">
       file = File.open(".bashrc")
       file.path       # returns value of ".bashrc" determined above
</pre>

h3. Creating Inodes and Files

Making the open(2) system call with the O_CREAT flag will create a file.

File.open can accept the equivalent IO::CREAT constant or with fopen(3)-style mode strings ("w", "a") to create an inode if the specified file name does not exist.

The Unix touch(1) command and FileUtils.touch method both create files with open(2) in this way.  Historically there is also a creat(2) system call for creating and opening files, but open(2) is more flexible and preferred.  Ruby does not use nor expose creat(2) to the user.

h3. Hard links

Since you should understand how two (or more) variables can point to the same object in Ruby, you should be able to understand how two (or more) file names can point to the same inode (and thus the same file) on one device.

Like two variables pointing to the same Ruby object, two (or more) links pointing to the same inode are indistinguishable from each other:

<pre>
       "filename_1" ------+
                          |
       "filename_2" ------+----> inode_number=123, device_number=456
                          |
       "filename_3" ------+
                          |
                         ...
                          |
       "filename_X" ------+
</pre>

Hard links to existing files are created with the File.link method which makes the link(2) system call.  There is usually a system-dependent limit on the number of links to a particular inode, File.link will raise Errno::EMLINK if this limit is hit.

h3. Number of Hard Links (File::Stat#nlink)

While inodes do not know which file name(s) point to it, inodes are aware of how many file names point to it.  Each time a hard link is created, the number of hard links to the referenced given inode is incremented.

File names may be removed with the unlink(2) system call (via File.unlink in Ruby).  Unlinking a file will decrement the number of links an inode has.  It is possible for an inode to have zero links to it and remain valid (which we will surely discuss later).

h3. File::Stat

File::Stat is the Ruby class to represent inode information to the user.  All of the fields mentioned above (dev, ino, nlink) are available from a File::Stat object.

File.stat is a wrapper for the stat(2) system call and returns a File::Stat object for a given path.

If you have a Ruby IO object (and thus file) open, you can use IO#stat to get the File::Stat object for the file descriptor belonging to the IO/File object.  IO#stat makes the fstat(2) system call instead of stat(2).

File::Stat is the Ruby equivalent/wrapper of the "struct stat" structure seen by C programmers.

We will discuss File.lstat when we discuss symbolic links.
